"""Optional cross-encoder rerank stage, shared by both search entrypoints.

Sits ABOVE the algorithm layer — after retrieval and merge, before
verify-on-read — so it applies identically to ``nc_semantic_search`` and
``POST /api/v1/search``, and to every search algorithm, without either surface
or any algorithm knowing about it.

Why before verification: reranking after it would mean verifying the whole deep
pool, i.e. one Nextcloud round-trip per candidate against a bounded semaphore,
which costs more than the reranker. Candidates are already ACL-filtered inside
Qdrant (``build_base_filter_conditions``); verify-on-read is a staleness check
on top. The consequence to know about is that a ghost record can occupy a rerank
slot and then be dropped, shortening the page — the same trade the existing
over-fetch already makes, with more headroom.

Reranking NEVER fails a search. Every failure path returns the input order.

        floor: The depth the surface would retrieve anyway without reranking.
        grouped: Whether the request uses document granularity.

    Two constraints, and they can conflict — the precedence is deliberate:

    1. **Never below ``floor``.** Reranking must not cause a request to retrieve
       fewer candidates than it would without reranking, which would drop
       results a caller was already receiving.
    2. **Capped for grouped search.** The grouped prefetch is bounded by
       ``MAX_DOCUMENT_PREFETCH``; asking Qdrant for more groups than that
       prefetch can fill makes it widen its grouping search and reorder the head,
       degrading candidates before the reranker sees them. Applied here rather
       than at config-validation time because granularity is per-request.

    **(1) wins when they conflict**, i.e. when ``floor`` alone already exceeds
    the grouped cap. That is not the cap leaking — it is the recognition that
    the *unreranked* path already requests ``floor`` groups and already pays
    that degradation, so honouring the cap here would not avoid it; it would
    only truncate the result set relative to the same request with reranking
    off. Degraded ordering is recoverable by the reranker that follows;
    missing rows are not. Pinned by
    ``test_grouped_clamp_never_drops_below_floor``.
