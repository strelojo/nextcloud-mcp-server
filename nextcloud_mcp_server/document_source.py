"""A file-backed handle for a document being ingested.

The ingest path used to carry documents as ``bytes`` end to end, so peak memory
scaled with document size at every step: the WebDAV body was buffered whole, the
same buffer stayed live through parse, embed and bbox extraction, and the
structured tier pickled another two copies of it across the ``to_process`` pipe.
A 1040 MB document therefore could not be parsed at all -- the isolated worker
died at startup, before pymupdf4llm ran.

A :class:`DocumentSource` is a *path* plus the metadata callers used to read off
the buffer (``size``, ``content_type``). Both PDF engines open a path natively
and read incrementally, so handing the path down replaces those copies with
demand-paged reads:

* pypdfium2 -- ``FPDF_LoadDocument`` (path) instead of ``FPDF_LoadMemDocument64``
  (bytes), which pins the buffer for the document's lifetime.
* pymupdf -- ``fz_open_file`` instead of ``fz_open_memory``; PyMuPDF's own docs
  warn that the stream form may exhaust memory on large files.

Note that opening by path bounds the *input* copy, not the parse working set:
PDFium still retains parsed page objects, which is what page-windowed extraction
in ``pypdfium2_fast`` addresses. The two fixes are complementary.

``MemoryDocumentSource`` keeps the in-memory case first-class -- notes, deck
cards and small files never touch the disk, and every existing bytes-based test
keeps working -- while ``SpooledDocumentSource`` owns a temp file for the
lifetime of one ingest.
