"""Cross-encoder reranking against a Cohere-protocol ``/rerank`` endpoint.

One wire format covers every backend we care about — Cohere itself
(``POST /v2/rerank``), a self-hosted `Infinity <https://github.com/michaelfeil/infinity>`_
(``POST /rerank``), a vLLM server (``POST /v1/rerank``), and the Astrolabe
embedding gateway (``POST /v1/rerank``): request ``{model, query, documents,
top_n}``, response ``{"results": [{"index", "relevance_score"}]}``. So this is a
single client and *which* reranker you use is configuration
(:func:`nextcloud_mcp_server.features.rerank_endpoint`), not a code path.

A plain-httpx client rather than a :class:`~.base.Provider`: the ``Provider`` ABC
is an embedding contract (``embed``/``embed_batch``/``get_dimension``) and a
reranker satisfies none of it. Mirrors :mod:`.gateway_batch`, the existing
precedent for a non-embedding upstream surface.

# Reranking a deep pool is a single forward pass per document, so the request

# Per-document character budget for the request body.
#
# Two independent reasons, both real:
#   1. ``document_chunk_size`` is operator-configurable with no upper bound, so
#      "pool size x chunk size" is an unbounded request body. At a large chunk
#      size a full pool exceeds a typical 1 MB ingress limit and fails as a 413
#      from the proxy, not as anything the reranker ever sees.
#   2. Cross-encoders truncate their input near the model's sequence limit
#      anyway, so text beyond roughly this length is not scored — trimming it
#      costs no ranking quality and buys proportional latency.
_MAX_DOCUMENT_CHARS = 2000

# The query shares the cross-encoder's sequence budget with each document, so an
# unbounded query would crowd out the text being scored. The HTTP search surface
# permits a 10,000-character query.
