"""Tier-1 fast PDF text extractor (pypdfium2).

A permissively-licensed (Apache/BSD-2) fast path that extracts a PDF's text
layer + page boundaries WITHOUT pymupdf4llm's expensive O(n^2) table/graphics
analysis. For born-digital PDFs (the tier-0 classifier's ``fast`` verdict) this
returns clean text in well under a second -- including the form/table PDFs that
timed out under pymupdf4llm (e.g. ``Student 1a.pdf``: 120s timeout -> ~1s here).

bbox is re-derived from the PDF bytes + ``page_boundaries`` by
``search/pdf_highlighter``, so this processor only needs to emit ``text`` and
``metadata["page_boundaries"]`` for chunk highlighting to keep working.

It deliberately does NOT recover tables/layout; a low-quality result is meant to
escalate to the ``structured`` tier (pymupdf4llm, graphics_limit-guarded) via the
registry (B2 escalation wiring).

    ``content`` is either the PDF bytes or a path to it. A path is preferable:
    ``PdfDocument(path)`` uses ``FPDF_LoadDocument``, which reads incrementally,
    whereas the bytes form uses ``FPDF_LoadMemDocument64`` and pins the whole
    buffer for the document's lifetime. Note this bounds the *input* copy only --
    the parse working set is bounded by ``page_window`` below.

    ``page_boundaries`` offsets index into the returned text, which is the page
    texts joined with no separator so the offsets stay exact (the contract
    ``search/pdf_highlighter`` and the chunker rely on).

    Pages are extracted in windows of ``page_window``, re-opening the document
    for each window. PDFium retains parsed page objects for the document's
    lifetime -- ``page.close()`` does not return them -- so a single open scales
    peak RSS with page count (a real 4003-page file measured 1914 MB). Windowing
    caps that at one window's worth; the freed arena is reused by the next
    window, so peak stays flat (100 pages -> 63 MB, unchanged output). Pass 0 to
    disable and extract in a single open.
