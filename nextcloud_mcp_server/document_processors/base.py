        Concrete on purpose: the default materialises the source and delegates to
        :meth:`process`, so every existing processor keeps working untouched and
        each can be migrated to a path-based parse independently. Override it
        where opening by path avoids holding the whole document in memory (the
        PDF engines); leave it alone where the processor genuinely needs bytes
        (OCR base64, HTTP upload backends).

        Note the default is where peak memory still scales with document size --
        ``read_bytes`` is deliberately greppable for that reason.

        The read is offloaded to a worker thread: for a spooled source it is a
        synchronous disk read of the whole document, and every processor except
        the two PDF engines relies on this default, so once streaming downloads
        are wired in a large non-PDF document would otherwise block the shared
        event loop for the full read.

        Ownership: the CALLER owns ``source`` and is responsible for its
        ``cleanup()``. Implementations must not clean up a source they were
        handed -- they do not know whether the caller still needs it (e.g. for a
        subsequent tier or bbox extraction). The bytes-based ``process()``
        wrappers create their own :class:`MemoryDocumentSource` and clean it up
