"""Spooled document downloads for the ingest path.

``read_file`` buffers a whole WebDAV response, so peak memory scaled with
document size: a 531 MB PDF OOMKilled a fast-tier worker mid-download, before
its size was ever evaluated. Streaming the body to a local file instead keeps
resident memory at one chunk regardless of how large the document is.

Lives in ``vector`` rather than ``document_processors`` because it needs the
Nextcloud client, and ``document_processors`` must not import ``vector`` (see
the layering note in ``document_processors/escalation.py``).
