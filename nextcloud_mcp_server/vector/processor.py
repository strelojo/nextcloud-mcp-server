    ``block_spans`` is the OCR tier's per-block geometry (``OCR_BLOCK_SPANS_KEY``):
    each ``{"bbox": [x0,y0,x1,y1] normalized, "start_offset", "end_offset",

    (half-open overlap: ``block.start < chunk.end and block.end > chunk.start``)

    The page guard makes attribution correct-by-construction independent of the

    single ``page_number``, so a block from a *different* page must not be
    attributed — its box would render on the wrong page at the wrong page's
    coordinates. The page-aware chunker keeps every chunk single-page (guard is a
    no-op), but the page-agnostic char-based chunker can straddle a page break: on
    Student 147, 9/16 char-based chunks pulled blocks from two pages. When a chunk
    has no ``page_number`` (no page boundaries), fall back to overlap-only.
    Conversely, a span without a ``page`` key is excluded from any chunk that has a
    ``page_number`` — ``_pages_to_text`` always stamps ``page`` on OCR spans, so this
    only affects externally-built spans.

    Returns ``chunk_index -> [bbox, ...]`` (a chunk spanning N blocks gets N bboxes,

    in the chunk INDEX but blind to the chunk COUNT — so re-indexing a document
    that now yields fewer chunks overwrites ``0..kept_chunks-1`` in place and
    strands every higher-index point from the previous run.

    Stranded points keep the OLD payload (``etag``, ``index_mode``,
    ``embedding_identity``), and both "is this already indexed?" reads take
    whatever a single UNORDERED ``scroll(..., limit=1)`` hands back:

    changed", the scanner re-queues the document, and the re-index strands the
    same orphans again — an ingest loop that never converges. For OCR-tier
    documents that re-burns the batch GPU on every scan cycle (Deck #1084, and
    the unclosed tail of #509).

    Called AFTER the upsert rather than clearing the document first, so the
    document stays continuously searchable and ``acl_principals`` on the
    surviving points is preserved.

    ``kept_chunks == 0`` is a no-op on purpose: a zero-point "success" (the
    silent short-embedding path) must never be allowed to wipe a good index.

    Never raises — deliberately UNLIKE its sibling
    :func:`~nextcloud_mcp_server.vector.placeholder.delete_placeholder_point`,
    which logs and re-raises (its caller does the swallowing). The difference is
    the position in the write path: this runs AFTER the upsert, inside
    ``process_document``'s retry loop, so propagating a transient delete failure
    out of an ALREADY-SUCCESSFUL index would re-download/re-parse/re-embed the
    document on every attempt and, once they are exhausted, dead-letter a file
    that is sitting correctly in the index — the exact "re-processing forever"
    class this function exists to close. Orphans are harmless until a read
    happens to pick one, and the next scan's prune clears them, so logging and
    moving on self-heals.

    Known ordering hazard (pre-existing, self-healing): the filter scopes on
    ``doc_id``/``doc_type``/``chunk_index`` with no etag or version check. If two
    tasks for the same document are in flight on different content and the STALE
    one lands last, it overwrites ``0..kept_chunks-1`` with old content and then
    prunes above it, dropping chunks the fresher, larger write had produced. The
    cross-worker dedup guard only covers the same-etag case, so the interleaving
    predates this function — but pruning changes its failure mode from "harmless
    stale orphan" to "silently drops fresher data", until the next scan

    ``index_mode`` (``"hybrid"`` | ``"keyword"``) is stamped on every event's
    metadata so the CP rollup can slice ingestion cost by mode without new metric
    names — a keyword doc (sparse-only, no embedding) and a hybrid doc bill the
    same ``bytes_ingested`` / ``bytes_stored`` metrics, distinguished only by this
    dimension. ``tokens_embedded`` is naturally hybrid-only: keyword docs pass
    ``token_count=0`` and the row is skipped.

    Metered dimensions (Deck #67 / #401), recorded independently:

    - ``tokens_embedded`` — the embedding request's token count, recorded for
      every *hybrid* document (skipped when ``token_count`` is 0, i.e. keyword
      docs). The same metric search records, so the meter bills embedding tokens
      whether they were incurred indexing a document or embedding a query.
    - ``pages_embedded`` — a charge for **parsing** (PDF page extraction / OCR),
      not a normalized content size. ``page_count`` is the real number of pages
      the document processor parsed. Text content (notes, deck cards, news
      items) is never parsed, carries no ``page_count``, and accrues **no**
      ``pages_embedded`` row — only ``tokens_embedded``. There is deliberately
      no chars/tokens-per-page constant: pages map 1:1 to parsed document pages
      (card #282).
    - ``bytes_ingested`` — the raw source size at ingestion time, recorded for
      *every* embedded document. For files this is the raw binary size fetched
      from WebDAV; for text doc types (note, deck card, news item, mail message
      — no binary) it is the UTF-8 size of the extracted text. The caller
      resolves the right source per ``doc_type`` (see the call site).
    - ``bytes_stored`` — the UTF-8 byte size of the chunk texts persisted as
      Qdrant payload excerpts, recorded for *every* embedded document. Reflects
      the indexed footprint and so includes chunk-overlap duplication; it is
      therefore typically larger than ``bytes_ingested`` for text content.
    - ``chunks_ingested`` — the number of chunks this indexing pass produced,
      recorded for every embedded document. This is the **billed** ingestion
      dimension (Deck #1036): it shares its unit with the ``chunks_stored``
      retention meter, so an invoice's indexing and storage lines are directly
      comparable. ``bytes_ingested`` is retained as a monitor-only signal.

    Best-effort and flag-gated: a metering failure is logged and never breaks
    indexing. ``chunk_count`` is the empty-batch no-op guard — a document that
    produced no chunks embedded nothing, so all events are skipped rather than
    writing zero-value rows. ``pages_embedded`` is additionally skipped when
    ``page_count`` is absent or not strictly positive — gating on the page count
    itself (not the ``doc_type``) keeps this correct if a future non-PDF parsed
    type starts reporting pages, and a malformed non-positive count meters as
    "no pages" rather than emitting a zero/negative billing row. The
    ``bytes_*`` events are likewise skipped on a non-positive count.

    Cross-repo note: the control-plane rollup silently ignores a ``metric`` its
    catalog doesn't know (see migration 007), so ``bytes_ingested`` /
    ``bytes_stored`` only bill once the CP metric catalog + Stripe meter learn
    them too (card #401).

    Privacy note: ``user_id`` stays tenant-local — the CP rollup aggregates
    GROUP BY (day, metric) into ``usage_daily`` (no metadata column), so nothing
    here reaches Stripe; it is retained only to keep Deck #67's future per-user
    attribution derivable from the app DB without a re-migration.

    one outer attempt (~30s) and defers. Don't stack a third retry layer here.

    Bounding the re-queue (GH #1345): being re-picked by the next scan is what
    lets a transient outage recover, but on its own it never terminates — a
    document that fails every round is re-downloaded and re-parsed forever. So
    exhausting ``max_retries`` also records a consecutive-failure count against
    the document's content version (``dead_letter.record_index_failure``), and the

    # document (identical for every chunk). Stamped on each file point as

    # user-agnostic, truly left-anchored containment. Best-effort: an empty list
    # (resolution failure, or a non-file doc type) leaves search on the file_path
    # MatchText fallback for this doc.

    # No cross-document ancestor cache here: this runs in the queue worker, one
    # DocumentTask at a time, decoupled from the scanner's scan pass — so unlike
    # the scanner-side backfill (which threads a per-scan folder_ancestor_cache
    # into claim_existing_index), sibling files under a shared tree can't share a
    # lookup here. A per-worker TTL cache is the follow-up if the bulk initial
    # scan's PROPFIND volume shows up (tracked with the search-side resolution
    # cache in ADR-033).

    # This first-index write is intentionally ungated (symmetric with file_path /
    # owner_id, which the processor also writes unconditionally on first index):
    # it *establishes* the value, so there is nothing to clobber. Only a LATER
    # divergent overwrite needs guarding, which is exactly what the owner-scoped
    # backfill does (it fires only when the key is absent, and only for the
    # indexer-of-record). A shared folder resolves to the same canonical fileid
    # for whoever walks up to it, so even a non-owner first-indexer yields the
    # correct shared-folder ids; the only divergence is a bounded handful of that
    # one principal's own mount-wrapper folder ids, which are harmless (only that
