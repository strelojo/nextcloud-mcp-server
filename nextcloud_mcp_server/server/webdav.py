            parse_document: How to handle a document (PDF, DOCX, image, ...):

                - ``"auto"`` (default): extract its text. Cheapest route that
                  works -- a PDF with a good text layer is read directly, and a
                  scanned one escalates to OCR when the server has OCR enabled.
                - ``"markdown"``: additionally reconstruct structure (headings,
                  tables) rather than returning a flat text layer. Costs a
                  second, slower parse and is bounded by a page ceiling, when it
                  cannot be honoured the response says so instead of pretending.
                - ``"raw"``: do not parse. Text files are decoded, anything else
                  comes back base64-encoded.

                Files no processor handles (plain text, JSON, archives) are
                unaffected by this argument.
            page_start: PDF only. First page to read (1-based). Omit it, and
                page_end, to read the whole document. Use a range for a long
                PDF: only those pages are parsed and returned, which is faster
                and keeps the response to a size you can use. The markdown page
                ceiling then counts only the requested pages.
            page_end: PDF only. Last page to read (1-based, inclusive). Omitted
                means through the last page. A value past the end is clamped to
                the last page and noted in parse_notes. Neither argument can be
                combined with parse_document="raw".

        Returns:
            ``ReadFileResponse``. Alongside ``path``/``content``/``content_type``/
            ``size``/``etag`` it always describes what you are actually holding:

            - ``parse_status``: ``parsed`` / ``failed`` / ``skipped`` /
              ``not_applicable``.
            - ``content_format``: ``markdown``, ``text`` or ``base64``.
            - ``parse_tier`` / ``parse_processor``: which extraction tier
              produced the content (``fast``, ``structured``, ``ocr``).
            - ``parse_notes``: **if this is non-empty, tell the user what
              degraded** (OCR unavailable, structure not reconstructed, size cap,
              parse failure) rather than presenting the content as the complete
              document.
            - ``etag``: pass this back into ``nc_webdav_write_file``'s
              ``if_match`` when writing this same path later, so a manual edit
              made elsewhere in the meantime (e.g. in the Nextcloud web UI) is
              detected as a conflict instead of silently overwritten.
            - ``url``: a link that opens the file in Nextcloud. Offer it when
              reporting on the file, and especially when ``parse_notes`` says
              the extraction degraded.
            - ``page_count``: total pages in a parsed PDF. With ``page_start``/
              ``page_end`` (the pages actually returned) it tells you whether
              more remains to read.

        Writes are **fail-closed**: an existing file is never silently
        overwritten. What happens depends on ``if_match`` (see below).

        Raises ``ToolError`` when ``EXCLUDED_TAGS`` is configured and the
        target path (or an ancestor folder) carries an excluded system tag,
        when the decoded content exceeds ``WEBDAV_WRITE_MAX_MB``, when the
        write conflicts with a concurrent edit or an existing/missing file
        (412), or when the file is locked by another client (423) -- see
        ``if_match`` below.

        Args:
            path: Full path where to write the file
            content: File content (text or base64 for binary)
            content_type: MIME type (auto-detected if not provided, use 'type;base64' for binary)
            if_match: Controls overwrite safety.
                - Omit (``None``) to **create a new file**: the write fails
                  with a ``ToolError`` if the path already exists. To change an
                  existing file you must first read it with
                  ``nc_webdav_read_file`` and pass the etag it returned.
                - Pass that **etag** to overwrite the file only if it has not
                  changed since you read it. If someone edited it in the
                  meantime (e.g. in the Nextcloud web UI) the write fails --
                  re-read and retry deliberately rather than looping.
                - Pass the literal ``"*"`` to **force-overwrite** an existing
                  file unconditionally (fails if the file does not exist).

        Returns:
            ``WriteFileResponse`` with ``path``, ``status_code``, ``size``,
            ``created`` (True when a new file was created, i.e. HTTP 201, False
            when an existing file was overwritten, i.e. HTTP 204) and ``etag``.

            ``etag`` is the file as just written — pass it straight back as
            ``if_match`` on the next write to chain edits without an intervening
            read. It is ``None`` when the server did not return one (some
            proxies strip it). Re-read the file to obtain it in that case.
