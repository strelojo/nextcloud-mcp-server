# App name → the key it publishes on /ocs/v2.php/cloud/capabilities, for apps
# whose absence should hide their tools. Verified against each app's
# Capabilities.php; an app missing from this map is NEVER gated, because
# absence of a key is what closes the gate and most apps publish nothing:
#
#   notes / tables / deck / cookbook → own key, carries `version`
#   talk                             → `spreed`; the whole block is omitted for
#                                      a user Talk is disabled for, which is
#                                      exactly when its tools should vanish
#   calendar (`calendar`, no version) and contacts (nested under
#     `client_integration`) are deliberately absent: those tools speak
#     CalDAV/CardDAV and keep working with the web app uninstalled
#   collectives / news / mail        → publish no capability block at all
#   shopping_list                    → likewise; gating it would hide working

#   webdav / sharing                 → core `files`/`files_sharing`, always there
