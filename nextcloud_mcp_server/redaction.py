"""Third-party redaction for SAR export archives (ADR-040).

"Detect once, match everywhere": NER yields the set of person names across every
document going into an archive, and redaction is word-boundary matching of that
set over each piece of text written to it: document bodies, titles, filenames and
the operator's inclusion reasons. Matching by surface form, rather than by stored
character spans, is what lets one detection pass cover all of them, and one
:class:`Redactor` per archive numbers each person consistently across it.

Two recall aids, both biased toward over-redaction, which is the acceptable
failure for a disclosure:

* **propagation** — a name detected once is redacted at every occurrence,
  including ones the model missed in context;
* **token expansion** — each token (3+ chars, not an honorific) of a
  multi-token name is redacted on its own, so a later bare "Smith" is caught.
  One deliberate exception: role and relationship words ("student", "Father")
  are never names, and a detection containing one ("Academic Mentor", "Father
  Brown") is redacted as a whole phrase only. Its other words are not expanded,
  so a later bare "Brown" relies on the model detecting it there.

Addresses are detected by NER too and propagate the same way, but as whole
phrases only: their words are never expanded, since redacting every "Street" or
"Road" would destroy the text. A single-word address ("Harbourvale") identifies no one
and is left alone. UK postcodes are also matched by pattern, so a postcode on
its own is redacted even where NER saw no address.

Emails, phone numbers and UK National Insurance numbers are found by pattern in
each text, not by NER, and are redacted wherever they occur.

The data subject passes through via ``keep``: their names, aliases, emails,
phone numbers, NI numbers and addresses. A detected address is kept when it is a
kept address or its leading part (house number first), never a bare street.
Kept names match first (longest match wins) and
are left as written. Tokens of a detected name that is itself kept are not
expanded, so a bare "Jane" survives when only "Jane Doe" is the subject — unless
"Jane" is also a token of some third party's name, in which case it is redacted.

Detection needs the embedding gateway's ``POST /v1/ner``, so redaction is
available only with ``EMBEDDING_GATEWAY_URL`` configured.
