# (PROPFIND / PUT / MKCOL / REPORT / MOVE / COPY), not OCS ones: they send the
# header only to identify themselves as API traffic to Nextcloud's CSRF check,
# and Sabre answers them in XML. The OCS constant also carries
# ``Accept: application/json``, which would be a lie here. Most of these sites
# additionally carry request-specific ``Depth`` / ``Content-Type`` values, so
# there is nothing shared left to hoist -- keep writing them inline. The guard
# in ``tests/unit/test_ocs_headers_are_shared`` only rejects the OCS+JSON

        (RFC 5323) filtered on ``oc:fileid``, returning True iff the user can
        currently access the file.

        This is the only check that resolves shared files correctly:

        - :meth:`get_file_info` resolves a path under the caller's *own* root,
          so it 404s on a file shared into the caller's account (Nextcloud

        - The ``/remote.php/dav/meta/{id}/`` endpoint resolves only the user's
          *own* storage, so it 404s on shared files too.

        SEARCH-by-fileid handles all cases: owned files, directly-shared files,
        and files reachable via a shared parent folder (verified empirically).
