#: Marks a request whose body the caller intends to consume incrementally.

#: httpx runs response event hooks BEFORE the body is fetched, so a hook that
#: calls ``aread()`` pulls the whole body into memory and leaves nothing for the
#: caller's ``aiter_bytes()`` loop -- silently turning a streamed download into a
#: buffered one. ``log_response`` checks for this marker and skips reading.

#: them. 429 means "slow down", so the wait is long and flat.

#: Retries allowed for a lock-contended (423) call, and the base backoff.
#:
#: 423 is a different failure from 429 and wants a different policy. Nextcloud
#: raises ``OCP\Lock\LockedException`` when it cannot upgrade a shared lock to
#: an exclusive one. Observed in CI as a note create and a concurrent note
#: LIST both calling ``mkdir`` on the same Notes folder: each holds a shared
#: lock on the path and each wants to upgrade, so neither can.
#:
#: **The jitter is the load-bearing part, not the doubling.** With a fixed
#: schedule both callers -- they are both this client, since the vector-sync
#: scanner reads the same user's notes -- back off by the same amount and
#: retry at the same instant, so they re-collide on every attempt. That is not
#: a hypothesis: a CI run showed the two requests failing at four identical
#: timestamps in a row before the budget ran out. Randomising the wait
#: desynchronises them so one acquires the exclusive lock and the other
#: follows.
#:
#: The budget is deliberately small and the original 423 is re-raised once it
#: is spent: a lock held by a long upload or an open editing session is a real
#: refusal, and this must never turn one into an unbounded wait.

    * **429 Too Many Requests** -- the server is rate limiting. Waits
      ``RATE_LIMIT_BACKOFF_SECONDS`` and retries, up to ``MAX_RETRIES``
      attempts, then raises ``RuntimeError``.
