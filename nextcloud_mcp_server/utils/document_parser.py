"""Document parsing utilities using the pluggable processor registry.

Two jobs live here:

* :func:`parse_document_source` runs the tiered pipeline against a document that
  is already on disk, and
* :func:`summarize_parse` turns the resulting :class:`ProcessingResult` into the
  handful of plain statements a caller needs to describe what it actually got.

The second exists because a parse can degrade in half a dozen ways that all look
identical from the outside -- a scanned PDF on a tenant without OCR, a
600-page document past the markdown ceiling, an oversize file the guard
rejected, a timeout -- and returning text without saying which of those happened
is how a caller ends up presenting a partial extraction as the whole document.
Every one of those statements is written here, once, so the wording cannot drift
between call sites.
