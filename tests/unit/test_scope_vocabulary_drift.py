"""Guards against drift between the places that list scopes.

``ALL_SUPPORTED_SCOPES`` is the vocabulary; several other lists must cover it.
Each has drifted at least once, and every time the symptom was the same: a tool
that works under BasicAuth and is permanently uncallable in OAuth / Login Flow
v2, because the scope it requires can never be granted. ``mail.send`` went that
way, then ``semantic.read`` (GH #1277).

These are cheap set comparisons — the point is that they fail here rather than
in a deployment.
