"""Unit tests for the file-backed document handle.

``DocumentSource`` exists so a processor can open a document by path instead of
receiving its bytes. The properties worth pinning are the ones that keep peak
memory bounded (a spooled source never materialises), the ones that keep the
in-memory case cheap (a small document never touches disk unless asked), and the
cleanup behaviour a crash-looping worker depends on.
