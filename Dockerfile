# Runtime directory: the settings.toml mount and data/ only. Pre-creating
# data/ with the right owner matters -- docker seeds a named volume's
# ownership from the image path, so a fresh volume comes up writable instead
# of root-owned 0755.
#
# A real account rather than a bare numeric USER: appuser gets a passwd
# entry, so getpwuid() resolves and HOME lands in /home/appuser instead of
# the base image's /root. No password and a nologin shell -- it is only ever
# switched to by the runtime, never logged into.
#
# The home directory is load-bearing, not cosmetic. /root is mode 0700
# root-owned, so a non-root process cannot even traverse it; huggingface_hub
# trips over that while resolving paths and fastembed's BM25 weight fetch
# dies with "Could not load model Qdrant/bm25 from any source", taking
# hybrid search's sparse vectors with it. Verified under a read-only root
# filesystem too, matching the chart's readOnlyRootFilesystem pods.
#
# uid 1000 / gid 0 reproduces what the helm chart already runs
# (runAsUser: 1000, no runAsGroup -> gid 0), so nothing about the pod
# changes. The venv stays root-owned: a compromised process parsing a
# hostile document cannot rewrite its own code.
